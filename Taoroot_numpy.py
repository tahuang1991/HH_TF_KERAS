    """Convert a tree into a numpy structured array.

    Convert branches of strings and basic types such as bool, int, float,
    double, etc. as well as variable-length and fixed-length multidimensional
    arrays and 1D or 2D vectors of basic types and strings. ``tree2array`` can
    also create columns in the output array that are expressions involving the
    TTree branches (i.e. ``'vect.Pt() / 1000'``) similar to ``TTree::Draw()``.
    See the notes below for important details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree : ROOT TTree instance
        The ROOT TTree to convert into an array.
    branches : list of strings and tuples or a string or tuple, optional (default=None)
        List of branches and expressions to include as columns of the array or
        a single branch or expression in which case a nonstructured array is
        returned. If None then include all branches that can be converted.
        Branches or expressions that result in variable-length subarrays can be
        truncated at a fixed length by using the tuple ``(branch_or_expression,
        fill_value, length)`` or converted into a single value with
        ``(branch_or_expression, fill_value)`` where ``length==1`` is implied.
        ``fill_value`` is used when the original array is shorter than
        ``length``. This truncation is after any object selection performed
        with the ``object_selection`` argument.
    selection : str, optional (default=None)
        Only include entries fulfilling this condition. If the condition
        evaluates to multiple values per tree entry (e.g. conditions on array
        branches) then an entry will be included if the condition evaluates to
        true for at least one array element.
    object_selection : dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary mapping selection strings to branch names or lists of
        branch names. Only array elements passing the selection strings will be
        included in the output array per entry in the tree. The branches
        specified must be variable-length array-type branches and the length of
        the selection and branches it acts on must match for each tree entry.
        For example ``object_selection={'a > 0': ['a', 'b']}`` will include all
        elements of 'a' and corresponding elements of 'b' where 'a > 0' for
        each tree entry. 'a' and 'b' must have the same length in every tree
        entry.
    start, stop, step: int, optional (default=None)
        The meaning of the ``start``, ``stop`` and ``step`` parameters is the
        same as for Python slices. If a range is supplied (by setting some of
        the ``start``, ``stop`` or ``step`` parameters), only the entries in
        that range and fulfilling the ``selection`` condition (if defined) are
        used.
    include_weight : bool, optional (default=False)
        Include a column containing the tree weight ``TTree::GetWeight()``.
        Note that this will be the same value for all entries unless the tree
        is actually a TChain containing multiple trees with different weights.
    weight_name : str, optional (default='weight')
        The field name for the weight column if ``include_weight=True``.
    cache_size : int, optional (default=-1)
        Set the size (in bytes) of the TTreeCache used while reading a TTree. A
        value of -1 uses ROOT's default cache size. A value of 0 disables the
        cache.

    Notes
    -----
    Types are converted according to the following table:

    .. _conversion_table:

    ========================  ===============================

    ========================  ===============================

    * Variable-length arrays (such as ``x[nx][2]``) and vectors (such as
      ``vector<int>``) are converted to NumPy arrays of the corresponding
      types.

    * Fixed-length arrays are converted to fixed-length NumPy array fields.

    **Branches with different lengths:**

    Note that when converting trees that have branches of different lengths
    into numpy arrays, the shorter branches will be extended to match the
    length of the longest branch by repeating their last values. If all
    requested branches are shorter than the longest branch in the tree, this
    will result in a "read failure" since beyond the end of the longest
    requested branch no additional bytes will be read from the file and
    root_numpy is unable to distinguish this from other ROOT errors that result
    in no bytes being read. In this case, explicitly set the ``stop`` argument
    to the length of the longest requested branch.

    Returns
    -------
    root_tree : a ROOT TTree

    Notes
    -----
    When using the ``tree`` argument to extend and/or add new branches to an
    existing tree, note that it is possible to create branches of different
    lengths. This will result in a warning from ROOT when root_numpy calls the
    tree's ``SetEntries()`` method. Beyond that, the tree should still be
    usable. While it might not be generally recommended to create branches with
    differing lengths, this behaviour could be required in certain situations.
    root_numpy makes no attempt to prevent such behaviour as this would be more
    strict than ROOT itself. Also see the note about converting trees that have
    branches of different lengths into numpy arrays in the documentation of
    :func:`tree2array`.
